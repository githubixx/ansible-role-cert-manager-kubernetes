# https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/cert-manager/cert-manager#configuration
# But for most users "installCRDs=true" should be sufficient.
# If true, CRD resources will be installed as part of the Helm chart.

# To install "ClusterIssuer" for Let's Encrypt (LE) "cert_manager_le_clusterissuer_options"
# needs to be defined. The variable contains a list of hashes and can be defined
# in "group_vars/all.yml" e.g.
#
# name:   Defines the name of the "ClusterIssuer"
# email:  Use a valid e-mail address to be alerted by LE in case a certificate
#         expires
# server: Hostname part of the LE URL
# private_key_secret_ref_name:  Name of the secret which stores the private key
# solvers_http01_ingress_class: Value of "kubernetes.io/ingress.class" annotation.
#                               Depends on your ingress controller. Common values
#                               are "traefik" for Traefik or "nginx" for nginx.
#
# Besides "email" the following values can be used as is and will create valid
# "ClusterIssuer" for Let's Encrypt staging and production. Only "email" needs
# to be adjusted if Traefik is used as ingress controller. For other ingress
# controllers "solvers_http01_ingress_class" needs to be adjusted too. Currently
# only "ClusterIssuer" and "http01" solver is implemented. For definition also
# see "tasks/install-issuer.yml".
